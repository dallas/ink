Hi, and welcome to my first ever public Rails project.
So very excite!

Anyway, to get started with this stuff, just run script/install.

After that, you'll want to edit these lines of config/environment.rb:
    PASSWORD   = 'secret'
    BLOGNAME   = 'ink'
    BLOGTITLE  = 'using ink to write a blog'
    BLOGAUTHOR = 'pen'

I am aware that the current "authentication" system is quite janky, but I did warn you.
I told you this was a _simple_ blog platform and that it is also my _very first_ public project.

So you, like me, will just have to endure.


Some things that it might be nice to know (after running script/install, of course):

	- There is a place for you to put some footer content at
		app/views/content/_footer.html.erb
	- There is a design/ directory where you can put whatever design files you need
		(such as design/ink/*.psd)
	- Any and all styles you put in public/stylesheets/ (such as public/stylesheets/styles.css)
		will not be harmed by future updates ink only needs the stylesheets in public/stylesheets/ink/
	- Pretty much, if you come across a directory or file named ink or that has ink as a prominent part of its name,
		don't touch it and we should all be okay.
